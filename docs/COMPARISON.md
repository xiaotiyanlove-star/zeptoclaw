ZeroClaw and ZeptoClaw take different security approaches. ZeroClaw focuses on access control — gateway pairing, sender allowlists, secret encryption, autonomy levels. ZeptoClaw focuses on content security — prompt injection detection, leak scanning, SSRF prevention, policy engine — and now also has secret encryption at rest (XChaCha20-Poly1305 + Argon2id) and deny-by-default sender allowlists. Both block sensitive filesystem paths.

**Known vulnerabilities:** OpenClaw's ecosystem has seen CVE-2026-25253 (CVSS 8.8 — WebSocket hijacking to RCE), ClawHavoc (341 malicious skills), and 42,000 exposed instances. The other projects have no known CVEs as of this writing.

## Memory & Context

| Feature | OpenClaw | PicoClaw | NanoClaw | ZeroClaw | ZeptoClaw |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Session persistence | Yes | Yes | Yes (SQLite) | Yes (SQLite) | Yes |
| Conversation history CLI | No | No | No | No | Yes (list, show, search, cleanup) |
| Long-term memory | Vector embeddings (SQLite) | Markdown files | Per-group CLAUDE.md | SQLite + Markdown backends | JSON KV store (categories, tags) |
| Memory search | Hybrid (keyword + vector) | Text search | No (file-based) | Hybrid (FTS5 BM25 + vector cosine) | Fuzzy search + chunked scoring |
| Embedding support | Yes (multiple) | No | No | Yes (OpenAI, custom URL) | No |
| Global shared memory | No | No | Yes (read-only global dir) | No | No |
| Token budget tracking | No | No | No | No | Yes (atomic per-session) |
| Context compaction | Yes (/compact) | No | No | No | Yes (auto-triggered) |

---

**OpenClaw** is the most feature-rich — 52 skills, 14 channels, companion apps, voice support. The tradeoff is size (100MB+), resource usage, and security incidents (CVE-2026-25253, ClawHavoc supply chain attack).

**PicoClaw** is the most portable — Go binary on $10 RISC-V boards with I2C/SPI hardware tools and Chinese platform channels. The tradeoff is no security layer (no injection detection, no leak scanning, no container isolation).

**NanoClaw** is the most minimal — 3.4K lines of TypeScript designed to be forked and understood in 8 minutes. Full container isolation per group, WhatsApp-first. The tradeoff is Claude-only (no other LLM providers), one channel, and no built-in tools.

**ZeroClaw** is the most provider-agnostic — 22+ LLM providers, built-in hybrid memory search (FTS5 + vector), secret encryption at rest, and 7 channels including iMessage and Matrix. The tradeoff is no container isolation (planned), no content security (injection/leak detection), and no multi-tenant support.

**ZeptoClaw** is the most secure and operationally complete — multi-layer safety, per-command container isolation, secret encryption at rest (XChaCha20-Poly1305 + Argon2id), sender allowlists, tunnel support (Cloudflare/ngrok/Tailscale), token budgeting, cost tracking, batch mode, hardware peripherals (ESP32/RPi/Arduino/Nucleo), and parallel agent swarms in a 4MB binary. 9 channels including Serial for embedded devices. The tradeoff is no companion apps.

All five are open source, self-hosted, and built for developers who want to own their AI assistant. The right choice depends on your priorities: features (OpenClaw), portability (PicoClaw), simplicity (NanoClaw), provider flexibility (ZeroClaw), or security and efficiency (ZeptoClaw).
